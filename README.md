# pypulseq
Pulseq in Python

Pulse sequence design is a significant component of MRI research. However, multi-vendor studies require researchers to 
be acquainted with each hardware platform's programming environment.

`pypulseq` enables vendor-neutral pulse sequence design in Python [[1]](#references). The pulse sequences can be 
exported as a `.seq` file to be run on  Siemens/[GE](toppe)/[Bruker](bruker) hardware by leveraging their respective 
Pulseq interpreters. This tool is targeted at MRI pulse sequence designers, researchers, students and other interested 
users. It is a translation of the Pulseq framework originally written in Matlab [[2]](#references).

It is strongly recommended to first read the [Pulseq specification](pulseq-spec)  before proceeding. The specification 
document defines the concepts required for pulse sequence design using `pypulseq`.

## 1 minute demo
1. Clone this repository.
2. `cd` into this repository (or set as working directory in an IDE).
2. Run any of the example scripts on Python 3.6 or above.
3. Inspect plots!
?. Get in touch regarding running the `.seq` files on your Siemens/GE/Bruker scanner.

## Custom pulse sequences
Getting started with pulse sequence design using `pypulseq` is simple:
1. `pip install pypulseq` in your virtual environment (>=Python 3.6).
2. First, define system limits in `Opts` and then create a `Sequence` object with it:
    ```python
    from pypulseq.opts import Opts
    from pypulseq.Sequence.sequence import Sequence
    
    system = Opts(max_grad=32, grad_unit='mT/m', max_slew=130, slew_unit='mT/m/s')
    seq = Sequence(system=system)
    ```
3. Then, design gradient, RF or ADC pulse sequence events:
    ```python
    from pypulseq.make_sinc_pulse import make_sinc_pulse
    
    Nx, Ny = 256, 256 # matrix size
    fov = 220e-3 # field of view
    delta_k = fov / Nx
    
    # RF sinc pulse with a 90 degree flip angle
    rf90, _, _ = make_sinc_pulse(flip_angle=90, system=system, slice_thickness=5e-3, apodization=0.5, time_bw_product=4)
    
    # Frequency encode, trapezoidal event
    gx = make_trapezoid(channel='x', flat_area=Nx * delta_k, flat_time=6.4e-3, system=system)
    
    # ADC readout
    adc = make_adc(num_samples=Nx, duration=gx.flat_time, delay=gx.rise_time, system=system)
    ```
4. Add these pulse sequence events to the `Sequence` object from step 2. One or more events can be executed 
simultaneously, simply pass them all to the `add_block()` method. For example, the `gx` and `adc` pulse sequence events 
need to be executed simultaneously:
    ```python
    seq.add_block(rf90)
    seq.add_block(gx, adc)
    ```
5. Visualize plots:
    ```python
    seq.plot()
    ```
6. Generate a `.seq` file to be executed on a real MR scanner:
    ```python
    seq.write('demo.seq')
    ```
